# Comparing SEBI CSCRF with Global Cybersecurity Frameworks

This document provides a comprehensive comparison between the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Cyber Security and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF) and other major global cybersecurity frameworks, highlighting key similarities, differences, and implementation considerations.

## Executive Summary

The SEBI CSCRF framework establishes cybersecurity requirements for Indian financial market participants. While developed specifically for the Indian context, it shares many common elements with international frameworks such as NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS. This comparison helps organizations align their compliance efforts across multiple frameworks.

## Framework Overview

| Framework | Regulatory Authority | Geographic Focus | Industry Focus | Update Frequency | Compliance Model |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| SEBI CSCRF | Securities and Exchange Board of India | India | Financial markets | 2-3 years | Mandatory for regulated entities |
| NIST CSF | National Institute of Standards and Technology | United States (global adoption) | Cross-industry | 3-4 years | Voluntary (except for US federal agencies) |
| ISO 27001 | International Organization for Standardization | Global | Cross-industry | 5-7 years | Voluntary certification |
| PCI DSS | Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council | Global | Payment processing | 2-3 years | Mandatory for card processors |
| RBI Cyber Framework | Reserve Bank of India | India | Banking | 3-4 years | Mandatory for banks |

| Incident Reporting | SEBI and CERT-In | RBI and CERT-In |
| Security Operations | Recommended | Mandatory SOC |
| Governance | Board-approved policy | IT Strategy Committee at board level |
| Threat Intelligence | Referenced | Dedicated requirement |
| Red Team Testing | Not explicitly required | Mandatory for certain entities |

#### Implementation Considerations
- Financial groups with both banking and securities operations need both frameworks
- RBI framework has more detailed operational requirements
- SEBI CSCRF has more focus on regulatory reporting

## Framework Control Mapping

The following table maps key control areas across frameworks to assist organizations in implementing multiple frameworks efficiently:

| Control Domain | SEBI CSCRF | NIST CSF | ISO 27001 | PCI DSS | RBI Cyber Framework |
|----------------|------------|----------|-----------|---------|----------------------|

## SEBI CSCRF-Specific Requirements

The following SEBI CSCRF requirements have limited or no direct equivalent in other frameworks:

1. **Bi-annual comprehensive audit** - Most frameworks require annual assessments
2. **CERT-In empanelled auditor** - India-specific requirement
3. **Quarterly Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing** - More frequent than most frameworks
4. **MD/CEO signature on compliance reports** - Personal accountability requirement
5. **Specific incident reporting timelines to SEBI** - Regulatory notification requirement

## Framework Selection Guide

| Organizational Need | Recommended Primary Framework | Supporting Framework |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| Indian securities market participant | SEBI CSCRF (mandatory) | NIST CSF for implementation guidance |
| Global organization with Indian operations | ISO 27001 | SEBI CSCRF for Indian entities |
| Payment processing focus | PCI DSS | SEBI CSCRF for Indian securities operations |
| Indian banking and securities operations | RBI Cyber Framework | SEBI CSCRF for securities operations |
| General cybersecurity program development | NIST CSF | SEBI CSCRF for compliance requirements |

## Using Framework Synergies

Organizations can leverage synergies between frameworks to optimize implementation:

1. **Common Documentation Strategy**
   - Use ISO 27001 documentation structure as foundation
   - Add SEBI CSCRF-specific elements
   - Map controls to each applicable framework

2. **Consolidated Risk Assessment**
   - Perform comprehensive risk assessment covering all frameworks
   - Tag risks according to relevant framework requirements
   - Prioritize control implementation based on multiple framework requirements

3. **Unified Audit Approach**
   - Schedule coordinated assessments
   - Use specialized assessors for framework-specific requirements
   - Maintain continuous compliance monitoring

4. **Control Implementation Prioritization**
   - Implement controls meeting multiple framework requirements first
   - Address framework-specific controls based on compliance deadlines
   - Focus on high-impact controls common across frameworks

## Latest Updates to SEBI CSCRF

The most recent updates to the SEBI CSCRF framework (as of the circular dated December 3, 2018) introduced several new requirements:

1. Enhanced governance requirements with board-level oversight
2. Quarterly vulnerability assessments by CERT-In empanelled organizations
3. Enhanced security operations center (SOC) capabilities
4. Stricter third-party risk management requirements
5. Enhanced incident reporting timelines

These updates align SEBI CSCRF more closely with international best practices while maintaining its focus on the unique needs of the Indian financial market infrastructure.

## Conclusion

While SEBI CSCRF shares many common elements with global cybersecurity frameworks, it contains India-specific requirements that regulated entities must address. Organizations can optimize their cybersecurity programs by understanding these similarities and differences, leveraging existing framework implementations while addressing SEBI CSCRF-specific requirements.

For entities subject to SEBI CSCRF requirements, the framework should serve as the baseline compliance standard, with other frameworks providing implementation guidance and additional best practices.
