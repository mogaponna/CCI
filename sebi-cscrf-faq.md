# Frequently Asked Questions: SEBI Cyber Security and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF)

## General Questions

### What is the SEBI CSCRF?
The SEBI Cyber Security and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF) is a set of guidelines and requirements issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to strengthen the cyber security posture of regulated entities in the Indian securities market. It provides a structured approach to managing cyber risks and ensuring the resilience of critical market infrastructure.

### Which entities are required to comply with SEBI CSCRF?
The SEBI CSCRF applies to Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs) such as stock exchanges, clearing corporations, and depositories, as well as other regulated entities including brokers, mutual funds, registrars and transfer agents, and other intermediaries in the securities market regulated by SEBI.

### When was the SEBI CSCRF first introduced?
SEBI first introduced the Cyber Security and Cyber Resilience framework in 2015 for Market Infrastructure Institutions. The framework has been periodically updated with the latest significant update in December 2018.

### What are the key components of the SEBI CSCRF?
The key components include:
- Governance and organizational structure
- Protection of critical assets and data
- Network security
- Security monitoring and incident response
- Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing
- Capacity building and training
- Periodic audits and reporting
- Business continuity planning
- Third-party risk management

### How often are entities required to conduct audits under SEBI CSCRF?
Regulated entities must conduct comprehensive audits of their cyber security and cyber resilience framework at least twice a year (bi-annually). These audits must be performed by certified auditors empanelled with CERT-In (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team).

## Compliance Questions

### What is the deadline for compliance with SEBI CSCRF?
SEBI has mandated immediate compliance with the framework for all regulated entities. Any new circulars or amendments typically include specific implementation timelines, generally ranging from 3-6 months from the date of issuance.

### What are the consequences of non-compliance with SEBI CSCRF?
Non-compliance can result in regulatory actions including:
- Monetary penalties
- Suspension or cancellation of registration
- Restriction on business activities
- Increased regulatory scrutiny
- Reputational damage

### How does SEBI verify compliance with the CSCRF?
SEBI verifies compliance through:
- Mandatory bi-annual audit reports submitted by regulated entities

### Can we use a risk-based approach for implementing SEBI CSCRF?
Yes, SEBI acknowledges that a risk-based approach is appropriate for implementing the framework. Organizations should identify their critical assets, assess risks, and implement controls commensurate with the identified risks. However, certain baseline requirements are mandatory regardless of risk assessment outcomes.

### Are there any exemptions available for smaller entities?
While SEBI expects all regulated entities to comply with the framework, the implementation may be proportionate to the size, nature, and complexity of the organization. However, there are no formal exemptions, and all regulated entities must implement the core requirements.
